# PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY - SPECIALIZATION
## Offered by UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
## on COURSERA


The below mentioned assignments are solved for the course "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)" offered by University of Michigan on Coursera. This course is the first course (in a total of 5 courses) in the Python For Everybody Specialization. These exercises covers Chapters 1 to 5 of the textbook "Python For Everybody - Exploring Data in Python 3" by Charles Severance.



#### Exercise 2.2

Write a program that uses "input" to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them


#### Exercise 2.3

Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.


#### Exercise 3.1

Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.


#### Exercise 3.3

Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using a given table. If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit.


#### Exercise 4.6

Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value.


#### Exercise 5.2

Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number.
